I’ve made two big decisions today! I will be returning to school to finish my bachelor's degree, and I will be retiring from the film exhibition industry after twenty years. There’s a lot to unpack here, especially since you don’t know me, but I’ll try to stick to the abridged version for this post. My academic career is quite the ride. From a High School drop out to my senior year studying Computer Science… to a 15-year hiatus, and now back to finishing that senior year. In a future blog post, I will reflect deeper on that story. For now, I’m just very excited to have the opportunity to finish without having to go through the gauntlet of Calculus courses all over again! A BIG THANK YOU to Towson University for allowing me to continue under a new catalog rather than starting over.

I last attended Towson University back in 2007 when a mere seven classes away from graduating, I had to accept that could not afford the tuition any longer. An obvious question in the mind of whomever is reading this must be, “why didn’t you take out a student loan and finish?” Unfortunately, I was not eligible at the time for loans, or scholarships, or in-state-tuition for that matter. From the time that I started at a community college through my (almost-completed) senior year at University, I had no choice but to work seventy to eighty hours a week to pay tuition out of pocket. The “why” is complicated, but to summarize, I was in the middle of what turned out to be a thirty-two-year immigration battle that fortunately had a happy ending, but unfortunately not until I was well into my mid-to-late thirties.

I remember the day that I had to withdraw from my courses early into the semester, while I could still get a refund. I felt defeated to say the least, and what makes it worse is that I could see the fucking finish line! I couldn’t see beyond it, though, which was another scary note. With all the uncertainty from the immigration battle, there was no guarantee that all of the money that I paid in tuition was going to amount to anything. Government jobs were out of the question because a security clearance was impossible. Emotions got the better of me, and priorities shifted.

It wasn’t all bad, though. I have been fortunate to work for a couple of nice families over my time in film exhibition, and I advanced to a GM role that I’ve held for over a decade now. It’s a stable position that I’m happy to say has enabled my family and I to live just comfortably enough in our own home, debt free, and all that fun stuff. So why the change? Because I know that I was made to do more. I’m just not fully sure what that is anymore – not yet at least. Back in 2007, I was in love with the Software Engineering track, so my goal was clear. I wanted to be a software developer. As coding skills went, I wasn’t too bad. Unfortunately, I’m very out of practice. I spent some time during the 15 years learning different things on my own, but it’s hard without the right motivation.

Around September of 2020, while the country was shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I found myself with a lot of free time. I got an itch to jump back into coding, and I came across FreeCodeCamp.org, and I cannot stress enough how great that site is. I went through the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript courses partially before I dove into the Scientific Computing with Python course, which I took my time with and thoroughly enjoyed. Then in December of 2020, just a week before my thirty-seventh birthday, my life changed. That 32-year immigration battle that I mentioned earlier came to a dramatic close, and I was (finally) granted Permanent Residency status in the United States! I was beyond pissed! I’ll elaborate on why in another post since I promised the abridged version here.
