I’ve made two big decisions today! I will be returning to school to finish my bachelor's degree, and I will be retiring from the film exhibition industry after twenty years (not at the same time). There’s a lot to unpack here, but I’ll try to stick to the “abridged” version for this log. My academic career is quite the ride. From a High School drop out to my senior year studying Computer Science… to a fifteen-year hiatus, and back to finishing that senior year. In a future log, I will reflect deeper on that story. For now, I’m just very excited to have the opportunity to finish without having to go through the gauntlet of Calculus courses all over again!

I transferred into Towson University (TU) in 2005 from Baltimore City Community College (BCCC). In 2007, a mere seven classes away from graduating, I had to accept that could no longer afford tuition. An obvious question is why didn’t I take out a student loan and finish? Unfortunately, I was not eligible at the time for loans, or scholarships, or in-state-tuition for that matter. From the time that I started at BCCC through my (almost-completed) senior year at TU, I had no choice but to work seventy to eighty hours a week to pay tuition out of pocket. The “why” is complicated, but to summarize, I was in the middle of what turned out to be a thirty-two-year immigration battle that fortunately had a happy ending, but unfortunately not until I was well into my late thirties.

I remember the day that I had to withdraw from my courses early into the semester, while I could still get a refund. I felt defeated to say the least, and what makes it worse is that I could see the fucking finish line! I couldn’t see beyond it, however, which was another scary note. With all the uncertainty from the immigration battle, there was no guarantee that all the money that I paid in tuition was going to amount to anything. Government jobs, for example, were out of the question because a security clearance was impossible. Emotions got the better of me, and priorities shifted.

It wasn’t all bad, though. I have been fortunate to work for a couple of nice families over my time in film exhibition, and I advanced to a GM role that I’ve held for over a decade. It’s a stable position that I’m happy to say has enabled my family and I to live just comfortably enough in our own home, with little to no debt. So why the change you ask? Because I _know_ that I’m capable of more. I’m just not fully sure what that is anymore – not yet at least. Back in 2007, I was in love with the Software Engineering track, so my goal was clear. I wanted to be a software developer. As coding skills went, I wasn’t too bad. Unfortunately, I’m very out of practice at this point so it will take a long time to get back to where I was. I spent some time during the past fifteen years learning different things on my own, but it has been hard without the right motivation or goals.

Around September of 2020, while the country was shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I found myself with a lot of free time. I got an itch to jump back into coding, and I came across FreeCodeCamp.org. I cannot stress enough how great that site is. I went through the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript courses partially before I dove into the Scientific Computing with Python course, which I took my time with and thoroughly enjoyed. Then in December of 2020, just a week before my thirty-seventh birthday, my life changed. That thirty-two-year immigration battle that I mentioned earlier came to a dramatic conclusion, and I was (finally) granted Permanent Residency status in the United States! It was a glorious day… I was **pissed**. I’ll elaborate on why in a later log since I promised the abridged version here.

Once I got through the wave of emotions that came from that special day, I began to contemplate what I should do now that I am without the restrictions that I grew up with. School was a recurring thought, but the idea of having to restart from scratch was hard to accept. “Not a chance in hell will school allow me to just continue from where I left off!” and “You’re insane, old man, if you think that your brain can handle going back to school, especially with your work schedule!” I told myself, repeatedly.

I chose instead to keep learning on my own as I had accepted that my career path was cemented long ago. “I’m too old for a change at this stage in my life.” I finished the Python course on FreeCodeCamp.org and have a little certificate to prove to myself that I am indeed still capable of learning. I’m very proud of it. After that, I searched around for other things to learn. A good friend of mine introduced me to Udemy.com – another terrific site that I’m probably single handedly keeping in business thanks to all of the courses that I keep buying. I began taking a course on JavaScript and React, and I realized that I really miss learning. I even purchased a course called “Become a Trigonometry & Precalculus Master” by Krista King to prove to myself that I can still learn math. Full disclosure, I haven’t finished those courses, but they’ve provided me with the proof that I needed for myself.

**Now the fun begins**. Around October, my wife finally convinced me to reach out to TU just to see where I’d be. I also received a recommendation to check out Western Governor’s University (WGU) as it is an all-online school that allows one to work at your own pace, which would be great with my messy schedule. TU informed to go through the re-enrollment process and declare a major so they can compare and decide on what would still be acceptable. WGU requested my transcripts from BCCC and TU. Again, I reminded myself that there was no chance in hell that all my old math courses would be accepted so I re-enrolled as an IT major at TU and applied as an IT major at WGU. My thought was, I’ll pick something a little “easier” than Computer Science.

When I received my report from TU of what I would need to graduate as an IT major, I thought that a mistake had been made. The little green check marks on ALL my old classes suggested that they’d still count… I reached out to the head of the IT department and asked for clarification, and to my surprise, I was informed that the report was correct. I asked if that would be the case if I changed my major to Computer Science and was instructed to “give it a shot.” When that report came back, I almost cried. Still doubtful, I reached out to the head of the Computer Science department who has been unbelievably helpful. The only catch was that I’d have to add whatever new courses were included in the newer catalog, which translated to five more classes. For reference, if I major in IT, I’d need to take twenty-one classes to graduate, and if I major in Computer Science without a concentration, I’d need twelve (and no more math courses!) Around this time WGU got back to me and said that they’d accept a handful of courses but that I’d need to retake all math courses to meet their requirements, which I understood.

The decision between schools took me the better part of a minute. Same with the decision on the major. So, for my son whom I hope reads this to understand better why his old man is cranky all the time, and for anyone battling with big changes in your own lives with little to no information, I instill this piece of advice that I wish I had followed sooner:

**LESSON #1 – Don’t be afraid to ask questions**

So, **what’s with these logs?** I began writing this as a private journal to my son who is thirteen years old at this moment. However, I’m also very fond of helping others, so if my story can motivate someone in any way, that’d be a fun bonus. I’ll be documenting my journey as I return to school, and sharing my experience with juggling school, a busy work schedule, and parenthood. I’m on a mission to reset my life and make a big impact somewhere, and I’m taking y’all with me! And because mental health is very important, I have a fun idea that in each log I’ll try to provide updates on my mental status. I think I’ll call these “Mission Logs”.
I hope that you’ve enjoyed reading a little bit about my academic back story. If you want to learn a little more about what sparked this journey, please check out my About page.
