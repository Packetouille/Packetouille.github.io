I sat through my first class in fifteen years tonight! Even though it was a three-hour class on a Monday night, I spent the better part of my workday very excited. It was the feeling you got as a kid before you got on a rollercoaster (or whatever ride you found fun.) I’m very proud to say that I was the first one in the classroom. I had the _whole_ room to myself for twenty minutes before I realized why. After I grabbed my stuff and head next door, I grabbed the only seat that was available in the front-left corner of the class, which was fine by me. I set my stuff down, powered on the lab computer just in case we’d need it, and was ready to start taking some notes for the next three hours.

As the professor introduced himself, I took a good look around the room, and saw what I expected to see, which were a bunch of tired students already looking forward to the end of class – most either on their phone or laptop. Something that I did not expect, however, were the nerves that I felt once I realized that I was indeed the oldest student in the room – possibly even older than the professor. One gentleman towards the back of the class may be close to my age, but it’s hard to tell, and I wasn’t about to start asking random people how old they are. The course is called Metropolitan Information Technology Infrastructure, and the topics that we’ll cover sound interesting. Something about recognizing the IT needs, problems, and solutions of organizations in a metropolitan area as they relate to social, economic, and cultural contexts, and being able to explain characteristic features of a metropolis… That’s where Superman lives, right?

It didn’t help my nerves that our first exercise was to introduce ourselves. Can you guess which schmuck had to go first? I introduced myself and mentioned that It was my first class back after being out of school for fifteen years, and then I chuckled as I heard a few people, including the individual sitting next to me, welcoming me back. It was such a cool thing for them to do, and it put me at ease instantly. It was a moment that I will remember forever. At intermission, I ate my Belvita Breakfast Biscuit and checked in with my wife to inform her that I was still alive and didn’t run away from class. Basically, I was letting her know that she’d have a whole other hour and a half of peace and quiet.

The most challenging part of the night happened towards the end of the class when we were given a prompt to write about in a discussion board. It was a relatively simple prompt dealing with our understanding of what infrastructure is and describing types of infrastructures, things of that nature. As the whole room began typing, It was as if bells were being rung all around my head. I could not for the life of me concentrate on the questions. It took me about five minutes to finally start typing something. As people began signing out of their computers, packing up and heading out, an old feeling started to creep up inside. “How could they be finished, and I barely have a sentence down?” I spent a few minutes telling myself that if I can’t even answer these easy questions, how the fuck was I going to handle the actual work!? Fortunately, I remembered my headphones that were in my pocket, so I put them on, and I was able to concentrate _a little_ better. This is going to be a challenge that I’ll need to figure out, ASAP.

All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed tonight’s experience. I will keep this log entry short as it is currently almost midnight, and I have an 8am Intro to Cybersecurity class followed by work. This is Andres Londoño, student, signing off to get my jammies on and some well-earned shuteye.
