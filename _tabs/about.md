Greetings, and welcome to an inside look at my bumpy voyage to becoming a Network Engineer.

My name is Andres Londono, and I am currently a full-time employee in the film exhibition industry, student, and family man. In December 2021 (on my thirty-eight birthday) I made the decision to overhaul my life, because as it turns out, I believe that stability is overrated.

If you’re someone who feels trapped in your life and have been thinking of making a scary shift into a new field, then climb on board, make sure your seat backs and tray tables are in their full upright position, seat belt is securely fastened, and all carry-on luggage is stowed underneath the seat in front of you or in the overhead bins. Let’s share experiences and hopefully we can help each other out!
