Greetings, and welcome to an inside look at my bumpy voyage in pursuit of a higher calling.

My name is Andres Londoño, and I am currently a full-time employee, student, and family man. In December 2021 (on my thirty-eighth birthday) I made the decision to set in motion plans to retire from my current professional career in the film exhibition industry. I love my job, and I happen to work for an amazing family, but evidently, I believe that stability is overrated…

In January 2022, I returned to school after a _very_ long hiatus. While in my first semester back as a Computer Science major, and after joining the Cyber Defense Club, it was an overview of Wireshark that led me to find the passion that I had been longing for. Watching network traffic in action, for me, was love at first sight. Since then, my mission has been clear; I _will_ become a Network Engineer.

If I haven’t lost you yet, my guess is that you’re someone who may be looking into making a scary shift into a new field. If so, climb on board, make sure your seat backs and tray tables are in their full upright position, seat belt is securely fastened, and all carry-on luggage is stowed underneath the seat in front of you or in the overhead bins. Let’s help each other out by sharing experiences, questions, answers, fears, concerns, tips, or whatever it takes to learn from each other.
